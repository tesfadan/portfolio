For the past 18 months, I have been a part of an ambitious venture builder team, where I get to quench my creative thirst and be integral to the success of the startups we build. Working agilely and with a sense of ownership, I design, develop and create everything from design systems to wireframes, hi-fi designs, product demo videos and websites. It has been an incredible journey - one that has been full of challenges but always meaningful and rewarding."
