From there, all we had to do, was build patterns, flows, and components, that aligned with our principle & guideline."

During those sprints, we transformed wireframes into high-fidelity development-ready designs. The design process, from the wireframe to the finished design, involved multiple review cycles with the Head of Design, Product Owner & Engineering team members. Those reviews provided valuable feedback that improved the user and developer experience."
