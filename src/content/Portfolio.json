Once aligned on the visual language, we outlined a design principle and guideline to inform our design choices. One of the principles included that our user interface was conversational, playful & gamified. From there, all we had to do, was build patterns, flows, and components, that aligned with our principle & guideline."

It significantly increased the productivity of our design team & gave us more time to work on solutions, as opposed to building user interfaces from the ground up. It also enabled the engineering team to shorten their turnaround time on building features, as they had a library of UI components and patterns they could plug and play."

Following that, we created a few low-fidelity screens to help us identify the visual aesthetic aligned with our design guidelines and principles (see design system case study)."

During those sprints, we transformed wireframes into high-fidelity development-ready designs. The design process, from the wireframe to the finished design, involved multiple review cycles with the Head of Design, Product Owner & Engineering team members. Those reviews provided valuable feedback that improved the user and developer experience."
