        Modern Color is a web application I built to create and 
        store color schemes for my design work. It uses Vibrant.js 
        to extract prominent colors from an image. It also uses 
        Brain.js to check for contrast values for a better user 
        experience. The color schemes are saved for anyone to access 
        from anywhere.

        As a way of learning the design software Figma,

        design inspirations from streaming apps such as 
        Spotify and Netflix I was able to design a
